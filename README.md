<p>

You can use Auth.js with MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, MongoDB and SQLite or without a database. (See our [using a database adapter guide](/guides/adapters/using-a-database-adapter)).

You can use also Auth.js with any database using a custom database adapter, or by using a custom credentials authentication provider - e.g. to support signing in with a username and password stored in an existing database.
